# Welcome to Collaborating on Fantom

This is the github of Collaborating.vercel.app, which is a place to collaborate
with protocols on Fantom wanting short-term collaboration. Collaborators will
use the email associated with their github to authenticate and sign-in and to
display their collaborations.

This entire collaboration app is a clone of
[Liveblocks](http://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/nextjs-starter-kit) and the
starter-kit they have for team collaboration.

## Features

- Documents dashboard with pagination, drafts, groups, auto-revalidation
- Collaborative whiteboard app with a fully-featured share menu
- Authentication compatible with GitHub, Google, Auth0, and more
- Document permissions can be scoped to users, groups, and the public

## Get started

To get started, you can visit [Collaborating](https://collaborating.vercel.app)
to view the list of the projects seeking collaboration, fill out a form
specifying which one, and then start collaborating if selected.
